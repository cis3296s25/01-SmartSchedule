# Smart Schedule
The application takes into account the courses a student wants to take and all
available sections of each course. It then uses a scheduling algorithm to generate all possible
schedules without any time conflicts. This allows students to easily explore different scheduling
options. The application features a user-friendly interface where students can enter their course
preferences, view the generated schedules, and choose the one that works best for them based on
their personal needs and preferences
